# ABSTRACT: A single item to be benchmarked

=head1 SYNOPSIS 

Here you are, looking at the object for one specific item. At this level things
start to look much more like the unix 'time' command as this is a clock wrapped
around a single 'item'. 

As a matter of comparison, lets look at a simple example:

  time perl -e 'for(1..3){print $_}'

As a Tool::Bench::Item things would look something like:

  my $item = Tool::Bench::Item->new(
                  name => 'Example',
                  code => sub{qx{perl -e 'for(1..3){print $_}'}},
                  # to be fair we call perl again to include compile time
             );
  $item->run;
  printf qq{%0.3f\n} $item->times->[0];

This is a very simple example, with very simular outcomes. But there's more 
that an item provides, speciflcy the startup and teardown events. These are 
untimed CodeRefs that get run before and after the core 'code'. 

Here is another set of examples comparing to 'time':

  echo 'hello' > /tmp/example && time cat /tmp/example && rm /tmp/example

  Tool::Bench::Item->new(
      name     => 'Example with startup and teardown',
      startup  => sub{qx{echo 'hello' > /tmp/example}},
      code     => sub{qx{cat /tmp/example}},
      teardown => sub{qx{rm /tmp/example}},
  )->run;

In both cases we only timed 'cat' not 'echo' or 'rm'. 

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

REQUIRED.

Stores a string name for this item.

=cut

has name => 
   is => 'ro',
   isa => 'Str',
   required => 1,
;

=head2 code

REQUIRED.

A CodeRef that is to be run.

=cut

has code => 
   is => 'ro',
   isa => 'CodeRef',
   required => 1,
;

has [qw{pre_run buildup teardown post_run}] => 
   is => 'ro',
   isa => 'CodeRef',
   default => sub{sub{}},
;

has note => 
   is => 'ro',
   isa => 'Str',
   default => '',
;

=head2 pre_run

An untimed CodeRef that is executed only once before the run is 'executed'.

=head2 buildup

An untimed CodeRef that is executed everytime before 'run' is called.

=head2 teardown

An untimed CodeRef that is executed everytime after 'run' is called.

=head2 post_run

An untimed CodeRef that is executed only once after the run is 'executed'.

=head2 note

An optional string to better explain the item.

=head2 results

An ArrayRef that contains all the results.

=head2 times

An ArrayRef that contains all the times that a specific run took.

=head2 errors

An ArrayRef that contains all any errors that were captured.

=cut

has [qw{results times errors}]  =>
   is => 'rw',
   isa => 'ArrayRef',
   default => sub{[]},
;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run

  $item->run;    # a single run
  $item->run(3); # run the code 3 times

Execute code and capture results, errors, and the time for each run.

=cut

before run => sub{ shift->buildup->()  };
after  run => sub{ shift->teardown->() };

sub run {
   my $self = shift;
   my $loop = shift || 1;
   for (1..$loop) {
      local $@;
      my $result;
      my $start = time();
      eval { $result = $self->code->(); };
      my $stop = time();
      push @{ $self->times  }, $stop - $start;
      push @{ $self->results }, $result;
      push @{ $self->errors }, $@;
   }
   return $self->total_runs;
}
